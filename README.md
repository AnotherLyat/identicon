## identicon
identicons are predeterministic pattern generators, in this case it was made to create a pattern of triangles around a grid center with a series of possible shapes in the middle, each shape type will havve their own color.

right now each space besides the center have the chance of having or not having a shape while the center have 3 possible shapes,  then the color is formed from the hash, all together there should be around 3*10^188 possible combinations

# Improvement
honestly, i want to put other shapes, but i also liked the circular feel around the center, so i might try to put lines around instead, maybe even animate it to spin around the center, need to think about it
